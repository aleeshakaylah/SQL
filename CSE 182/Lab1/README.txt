Lab 1 - Volleyball Database Schema

In this lab, I created a schema which held several tables containing volleyball data.

create.sql: Creates the tables and the column labels within the tables
lab1_load_data.sql: Copies the data into the tables accordingly
showall.sql: Displays all of the tables within the schema
dropalll.sql: Deletes all of the tables within the schema
